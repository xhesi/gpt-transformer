# Jupyter Workspace

This project is designed to provide a structured environment for working with Jupyter Notebooks, specifically for Python-based data analysis and visualization.

## Project Structure

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and examples.
  - **main.ipynb**: The main notebook for the project, containing code, visualizations, and documentation.
  - **examples/**: Directory for example notebooks.
    - **sample.ipynb**: An example notebook demonstrating specific functionalities.

- **src/**: Contains source code for the project.
  - **__init__.py**: Marks the directory as a Python package.
  - **utils.py**: Contains utility functions for data processing and analysis.

- **data/**: Contains datasets used in the project.
  - **sample_data.csv**: Sample data for analysis or testing.

- **requirements.txt**: Lists the required Python packages for the project.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Open the `notebooks/main.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook to start working with the main analysis.
2. Explore the `notebooks/examples/sample.ipynb` for additional use cases and examples.
3. Utilize functions from `src/utils.py` for any data processing needs.
